# Qwork - A Tabs Saver Productivity Application
Project from CalHacks 2018, created alongside Alexis Wei, Jeffrey Kim and Xudi Lin. The premise of this project was that we wanted to create a simple web app that would allow users to save tabs in their current window in a browser like Google Chrome to be reopened later. We realized that we and many other students would often have too many tabs open to keep track of, often not all for the same purpose. This tabs manager, which saved tabs into "workspaces" could be reopened later to make it easy to switch to doing something else without losing the workspace for previous tasks. 

We planned to implement this using the product of a company called UIPath, which developed automation bots These bots simulate an actual user that can open applications, "click" on parts of the screen and perform functions like a regular user but with greater speed and insight into the current state of the computer. We planned to use it to go into each tab and save the URL, to be opened later. However, due to difficulties with programming the product itself as well as complications with making the actual API call, we failed to make it work.
